# My Reads App

Welcome to the My Reads App! This is a simple app that allows you to keep track of the books you are currently reading, want to read, and have already read.

## Description

After cloning or downloading the project, run `npm install` in the project root directory to install the necessary dependencies. Then run `npm start` to launch the project.

The project's home page contains three shelves:

1. Currently Reading
2. Want to Read
3. Read

At the bottom right of the page, you will find a "+" button that allows you to search for a new book and add it to one of your shelves. Every book, whether on the search results or on your home, will have a control button to change the shelf of the book accordingly.

This project is built using:

- ReactJS
- React Routers
- CSS
- HTTP
- REST Architecture
- Git
- Asynchronous HTTP Requests

## Usage

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/ibraheemz/my-reads-app.git
```

Then, navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies:

```
cd my-reads-app
npm install
```

Once the dependencies have been installed, you can start the development server with the following command:

```
npm start

This will start the app and open it in your default browser at `http://localhost:3000/`.
